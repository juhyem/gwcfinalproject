  <div class="rcorners1">
    <p style="text-align:center">As social media continues to become increasingly prevalent in society, the rise of political awareness follows suit. After all, it only takes a single click to reach the multitude. Although
      political awareness is valuable, it is naive to equate awareness with activism. We recognize that in order to achieve true political engagement, citizens must be present and engaged within their own communities,
      rather than solely in a virtual environment.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">Here at Catalyze, we endeavor to build a product that bridges this chasm between awareness and activism. We feel that social media lacks the necessary tools when it comes to activism, so we wanted to create a product that extrapolates the  structure of pre-existing social networks into an accessible platform that people can use to go out and voice their beliefs in the real world.
      By doing so, we hope to conduct the perfect marriage between awareness and activism. </p>

    <p>HELLO!! My name is Patrice and I am an aspiring storyteller. I really love reading and being able to make things from scratch instead of buying them.
      I have always loved crafts making personalized gifts or painting something for someone has always gave me great joy. My interest for film and photography
      really intensified around 2015 when I entered high school and recently I started to make my own videos through which I hope to make smiles. :)</p>

  <p>Hey there! I'm 17 years old and am currently a rising senior. Girls Who Code was my first experience with computer science and it has been the most
  fulfilling adventure. This program has inspired me to continue studying CS and hopefully pursue it as a major in college. I would like to thank my teacher,
  Kelsey, and my TAs, Jen and Kim, for always being so patient, kind, and willing to help. I'd also like to thank my amazing project group for being the best team
  imaginable, and also being great friends, too.</p>

Hi! I’m Neha Vardhinedi and I’m an upcoming senior at Dougherty Valley High School. Girls Who Code’s Summer Immersion program has given me all the tools and opportunities to explore my budding interest in Computer Science. I’m extremely grateful to have gotten the opportunity to participate in this program. I will continue to apply the knowledge that I gained from this experience and pursue a career in the tech industry.

  <p>Hello! I’m JuHye, almost 17 and a soon-to-be senior. I love the art of creating, whether it be through music, words, or most recently, code! Over the course of working on this website, I think I’ve fallen a little bit in love with computer science. Equipped with this new medium, I wish to continue creating technology through the rest of my life (or at least the foreseeable future).</p>
